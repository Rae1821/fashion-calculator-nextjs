# The Body Shape Calculator

This is a passion project that I decided to make because I love to help other women learn how to find their own style and the first step is to know your body shape! I love finding a way to combine my two passions, tech and fashion.

## Overview

### The concept

The project started as a way to provide an easy calculator to users to find their body shape. I also knew I wanted to add a section explaining some of the benefits of knowing your shape, how to measure yourself correclty, and also some FAQ's. After putting all of this together I decided it would be so fun to include an AI chatbot to help out with any styling questions the users might have.

## Built with

The first time I built this I used React with Vite and deployed to Netlify. However, I hit a wall when trying to hide my API key using Netlify's serverless functions so I decided to switch to Nextjs. It took me a minute to figure out Nextjs but I love how intuative it is! I really enjoyed the process of using Nextjs to build my React app along with TailwindCSS. Enjoy!
